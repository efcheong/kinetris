WINDOWS
MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO 2008


1. Install OpenNI

Download OpenNI 1.0.0.25 Unstable from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/OpenNI>. Unpack the archive, and
run "OpenNI-Bin-Win32-v1.0.0.25.exe" to install.

(I chose to install to "C:\SDK\OpenNI\1.0.0\".)

(Alternatively, download OpenNI 1.0.0.25 Unstable from <http://openni.org/>.)


2. Install NITE

Download PrimeSense NITE 1.3.0.18 Unstable from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/NITE>. Unpack the archive, and
run "Nite-Bin-Win32-v1.3.0.18.exe" to install. When asked for a license key, use
the key found in "KEY.txt" (this is the free key provided by PrimeSense at
<http://openni.org/>).

(I chose to install to "C:\SDK\NITE\1.0.0\".)

(Alternatively, download PrimeSense NITE 1.3.0.18 Unstable from
<http://openni.org/>.)


3. Install SensorKinect

Download SensorKinect 0.4 from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/SensorKinect>. Unpack the
archive, and run "SensorKinect-Win32-5.0.0.exe" to install.

(I chose to install to the default location.)

(Alternatively, download SensorKinect 0.4 from
<https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/>.)


4. Configure OpenNI and NITE

Open the folder that SensorKinect was installed to. Go to the
"SampleXMLs\OpenNI" folder, and copy the "Data" folder to the folder that OpenNI
was installed to, replacing the existing files.

5. Install Qt

Download Qt Libraries 4.7.1 from
<http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.7.1-vs2008.exe>. Run
"qt-win-opensource-4.7.1-vs2008.exe" to install.

Note: To avoid complications, do not install to a location with spaces (e.g.: do
not install to "C:\Program Files\Qt").

(I chose to install to "C:\SDK\Qt\4.7.1\".)

(Alternatively, download the LGPL version of Qt Libraries 4.7.1 for Windows
(VS 2008) from <http://qt.nokia.com/>.)


6. Configure system "Path" environment variable

Open the Start menu, and go to "Control Panel\System and Security\System". Go to
"Advanced system settings" in the tasks pane on the left. Go to the "Advanced"
tab, and click on "Environment Variables...". In the "System variables" list,
select "Path", and click on "Edit...".

Edit the "Variable value" field to add ";C:\SDK\Qt\4.7.1\bin" to the end (if you
installed Qt to a different location than I did, instead add ";", followed by
the location that Qt was installed to, followed by "\bin").

Click on "OK" for each window.


7. Confirm/correct paths in project file for Visual Studio

If you installed Qt, OpenNI, or NITE to a different location than I did, you
will need to correct the paths in the project file for Visual Studio.

Open "KinectBlocks.vcproj" in Visual Studio.

In the "Solution Explorer" panel, right-click on the "KinectBlocks" project, and
go to "Properties". Under "Configuration Properties" on the left, select
"NMake". Under "IntelliSense" on the right, edit the "Include Search Path" field
to correct the locations of Qt, OpenNI, NITE (ensure that each path ends
with "\include").

Click on "OK".


8. Confirm/correct paths in project file for Qt

If you installed Qt, OpenNI, or NITE to a different location than I did, you
will need to correct the paths in the project file for Qt.

Open "KinectBlocks.pro" in Visual Studio.

Find the "INCLUDEPATH" qmake variable, and edit the value of the variable to
correct the locations of OpenNI and NITE (ensure that each path ends with
"/Include", and be careful to use "/" instead of "\").

Find the "LIBS" qmake variable, and edit the value of the variable to correct
the locations of OpenNI and NITE (ensure that each path ends with "/Lib", and
be careful to use "/" instead of "\").

Save the file.


9. Compile

You should now be able to compile the project. Go to the "Debug" menu and select
"Start Debugging", or go to the "Build" menu and select "Build Solution". Expect
to see a lot of warnings--this is normal. If there are errors, however, they are
most likely because some of the paths were not entered correctly in the previous
steps.
