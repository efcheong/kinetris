                            HOW TO INSTALL KINETRIS                             


________________________________________________________________________________


REQUIREMENTS


You must have the standalone model of the Kinect, not the model that comes
bundled with the Xbox 360 S. The Xbox 360 S model uses a proprietary connector
that can't be connected to a PC.

WINDOWS


1. Install OpenNI

Download OpenNI 1.3.2.3 Unstable SDK from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/OpenNI>. Run
"OpenNI-Win32-1.3.2.3-Dev.msi" to install.

(Alternatively, download "OpenNI Unstable Build for Windows x86 (32-bit)
v1.3.2.3 Development Edition" from <http://openni.org/>.)


2. Install NITE

Download PrimeSense NITE 1.4.2.4 Unstable SDK from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/NITE>. Run
"NITE-Win32-1.4.1.2-Dev.msi" to install.

(Alternatively, download "PrimeSense NITE Unstable Build for Windows x86
(32-bit) v1.4.2.4 Development Edition" from <http://openni.org/>.)


3. Install SensorKinect device driver

Download SensorKinect 0.7 from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/SensorKinect>. Run
"SensorKinect-Win-OpenSource32-5.0.3.4" to install.

(Alternatively, download "SensorKinect 0.7" from
<http://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/>.)


4. Test the Kinect

Plug in the Kinect.

Open the Start menu, and try the NITE samples found in
"All Programs\Prime Sense\NITE\Samples", to ensure that everything was installed
and configured correctly. If a console window opens and then closes immediately,
it means there was an error, most likely because the sensor driver in the
previous step was not installed correctly.


5. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

Download Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/VC2010>, and run
"vcredist_x86.exe" to install.

(Alternatively, download
"Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)" from
<http://microsoft.com/>.)


6. Install Kinetris

Download Kinetris 1.0.0 Beta 4 from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows>. Unpack the archive to a folder
of your choice.


7. Play!

Run "Kinetris.exe" to play the game.

Slide your hand left and right to move the current tetromino. Swipe your hand up
to hold the current tetromino for later. Swipe your hand down to drop the
current tetromino. To rotate, first pull your hand back and make a circle, then
continue making circles to rotate the current tetromino. The game will pause if
you hide your hand from view (or if the Kinect loses track of it).

MAC


There are no Mac or Linux editions of Kinetris available at this time. However,
since Kinetris was created using the cross-platform Qt framework, and since
there are Mac and Linux editions of OpenNI and NITE available, it should be
possible to compile the game from source for Mac or Linux yourself. The source
code for Kinetris can be downloaded from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/source>.
