HOW TO INSTALL KINETRIS
WINDOWS


1. Install OpenNI

Download OpenNI 1.2.0.7 Unstable SDK from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/OpenNI>. Run
"OpenNI-Win32-1.2.0.7-Dev.msi" to install.

(Alternatively, download "OpenNI Unstable Build for Windows x86 (32-bit)
v1.2.0.7 Development Edition" from <http://openni.org/>.)


2. Install NITE

Download PrimeSense NITE 1.3.1.6 Unstable SDK from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/NITE>. Run
"NITE-Win32-1.3.1.6-Dev.msi" to install.

(Alternatively, download "PrimeSense NITE Unstable Build for Windows x86
(32-bit) v1.3.1.6 Development Edition" from <http://openni.org/>.)


3. Install OpenNI-compliant sensor device driver

Install the device driver for your sensor. Please consult your product manual,
product support, or the Internet, for instructions.


4. Test the sensor

Plug in the sensor.

Open the Start menu, and try the NITE samples found in
"All Programs\Prime Sense\NITE\Samples", to ensure that everything was installed
and configured correctly. If a console window opens and then closes immediately,
it means there was an error, most likely because the sensor driver in the
previous step was not installed correctly.


5. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

Download Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows/VC2010>, and run
"vcredist_x86.exe" to install.

(Alternatively, download
"Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)" from
<http://microsoft.com/>.)


6. Install Kinetris

Download Kinetris 1.0.0 Beta 5 from
<http://conanchen.com/Kinetris/download/Windows>. Unpack the archive to a folder
of your choice.


7. Play!

Run "Kinetris.exe" to play the game.

Slide your hand left and right to move the current tetromino. Swipe your hand up
to hold the current tetromino for later. Swipe your hand down to drop the
current tetromino. To rotate, first pull your hand back and make a circle, then
continue making circles to rotate the current tetromino. The game will pause if
you hide your hand from view (or if the sensor loses track of it).
