# Kinetris: You are the One Who Arranges the Blocks #

Kinetris is a tetrominoes game (i.e.: a Tetris clone) that uses the Xbox 360 Kinect, on the PC. It was inspired by a music video on YouTube entitled "Complete History Of The Soviet Union, Arranged To The Melody Of Tetris" (http://youtube.com/watch?v=hWTFG3J1CP8).

The game is written in C++ using OpenNI, NITE, and the Qt framework.​
